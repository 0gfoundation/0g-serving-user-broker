     * 1. To Ensure No Insufficient Balance Occurs.
     *
     * The provider settles accounts regularly. In addition, we will add a rule to the provider's settlement logic:
     * if the actual balance of the customer's account is less than 5000, settlement will be triggered immediately.
     * The actual balance is defined as the customer's inference account balance minus any unsettled amounts.
     *
     * This way, if the customer checks their account and sees a balance greater than 5000, even if the provider settles
     * immediately, the deduction will leave about 5000, ensuring that no insufficient balance situation occurs.
     *
     * 2. To Avoid Frequent Transfers
     *
     * On the customer's side, if the balance falls below 5000, it should be topped up to 10000. This is to avoid frequent
     * transfers.
     *
     * 3. To Avoid Having to Check the Balance on Every Customer Request
     *
     * Record expenditures in processResponse and maintain a total consumption amount. Every time the total expenditure
     * reaches 1000, recheck the balance and perform a transfer if necessary.
     *
     * ps: The units for 5000 and 1000 can be (service.inputPricePerToken + service.outputPricePerToken).
